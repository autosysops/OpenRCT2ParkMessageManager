# OpenRCT2 Park Message Manager

This plugin for OpenRCT2 allows you to managed the messages in the park. You can delete a single message or all the messages at once. You can also add new messages of different types. For now the plugin allows you to pick the type of message and it will show a preview image of the image which will be shown with the message. You can also select the colour of the text (which will also be previewed in the dropdown box).
